Working with APIs
==========================

A web API is a set of  programming instructions and standards for accessing web
based software applications. APIs base on exchange of HTTP requests, where both the request and the response contain a standardized set of fields.

Many APIs have language specific wrappers that simplify their usage, by replacing the exchange of raw HTTP requests with calling methods on API objects in the respective language.
