Python 3.x vs 2.x
-----------------------

This training is based on **Python 3.5.2** and the examples may not work with the previous versions of Python, especially with Python 2.x. We will not cover the differences or incompatibilities between the versions 2 and 3 in details.
Following what the official wiki states:

.. pull-quote::

    *Python 2.x is legacy, Python 3.x is the present and future of the language*

... we will concentrate on the newest version only.
